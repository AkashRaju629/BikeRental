,bicycles,"Hello everyone! This is my first post in this subreddit. Please bear with me while I explain this situation:

Four friends and myself are doing a 1000 mile tour to MO from VA in the beginning of April. I have no experience touring and am not in the best (or worst) of shape, (in fact, 3 of us are in this predicament) and 2 of my comrades are well-seasoned at touring and are willing to help us noobs along, so I feel pretty good about it.

Anyway, I decided to go with Surly's Long Haul Trucker model as I've heard it's very capable for this kind of stuff and is an all-around great bike, and I'm really looking forward to getting very intimate with it. 

So my questions are thus: I am looking to rig out the bike to make it as awesome as possible. I have a rack on the back, but am looking for one on the front that can handle some weight. I would also like to get some fenders and panniers. I don't know anything about the fenders, but as far as panniers go everyone seems to recommend Ortlieb panniers. I have some bike shorts, and suitable camping gear. Really it's just a matter of fitting out the bike (and my body!) in preparation for the trip. I have pretty much all the basic peripherals.

I haven't had a bicycle in about 15 years and now my work commute is very short.  I'm looking for a road bike in Los Angeles, and I think I've narrowed it down to a couple of them.

A few examples of bikes I've liked thus far are Bianchi Volpe, MASI CX's and Raleigh Clubman.

I'm not looking for a girls bike specifically. I just want a beautiful/classic bike that will last me a long time for what I need it for. I'm not super picky, but the bikes I have liked so far is the style I'm looking for. Steel would be great, but not a deal breaker at all. In my area there are a lot of hills and rainy winters, so maybe a lighter bike is actually better—I don't know.

* Biggest issue - space between the seat and pedals is **way** too short.  Obvious solution is to raise the seat and worst case buy one of those seat stems that bend backwards.  No brainer I'd think?

I had been thinking about getting a bicycle for a while, but seeing this ad today prompted me to look into it some more.

Also, is there anything else you might recommend around this price or cheaper? I haven't had a bike in a long time and I am seeking something for running errands and some leisure riding, perhaps through the park or on a nice day in the city, probably nothing too intense.

I live in Texas, it gets hot as hell(100+ 3-4 months of the year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few questions,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I solve the dress code issues(biking in a suit doesn&amp;#39;t sound practical)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What sort of bike should I check out?(We have tons of LBS in San Marcos).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other ammunition can y&amp;#39;all provide to help me make this pitch to my wife(for the bike capital).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you everyone for your input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 1: I work the evening shift so I will be returning home at midnight 4 nights/week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: I&amp;#39;d also like to use the bike for pleasure rides/fitness reasons. My wife is planning to get a bike as well for the same reasons(minus the commuting, she works from home).&lt;/p&gt;

I find I have to ride with my saddle tilted forward so much that every time I bring the bike to the shop they offer to ""fix it"" for me.

2) It seems like there is a strong emphasis on a) avoiding particularly padded saddles, b) wearing padded bike shorts. This always confused me. Why is padding on the saddle bad but padding on my shorts good?

**Plasti Dip**
""Multi-Purpose Rubber Coating""

Line a bunch of zip-ties on some old cardboard and spray the underside of the zip-tie, that will contact the frame, with a few passes of the magic spray.

Four friends and myself are doing a 1000 mile tour to MO from VA in the beginning of April.

Anyway, I decided to go with Surly's Long Haul Trucker model as I've heard it's very capable for this kind of stuff and is an all-around great bike, and I'm really looking forward to getting very intimate with it. 

So my questions are thus: I am looking to rig out the bike to make it as awesome as possible. I have a rack on the back, but am looking for one on the front that can handle some weight. I would also like to get some fenders and panniers. I don't know anything about the fenders, but as far as panniers go everyone seems to recommend Ortlieb panniers. I have some bike shorts, and suitable camping gear. Really it's just a matter of fitting out the bike (and my body!) in preparation for the trip. I have pretty much all the basic peripherals.

I have pretty much all the basic peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really just looking for ANY advice that would be helpful, whether it&amp;#39;s gear-related stuff, training stuff, general wisdom from touring or anything else you might think is relevant. Thanks for all your help! Love you guys :D&lt;/p&gt;

Here's a pic by the way.  Paid $250.  (Not bad deal?)
http://i.imgur.com/jK6zP.jpg

So now that I have it and have ridden a bit, I have a few questions:

* Biggest issue - space between the seat and pedals is **way** too short.  Obvious solution is to raise the seat and worst case buy one of those seat stems that bend backwards.  No brainer I'd think?  
* However, one issue that will cause is, I'll have to lean waaaaay over to reach the handlebars.  Is there some sort of an extension I can get to raise the handlebars 3 to 6 inches?  (This is my most important question, and couldn't really find anything on google.)  
* Finally - the rear brakes don't grab really well.  Not oily or anything like that, but they really slip.  Could it possibly be old brittle brake pads?

&lt;a href=""http://i.imgur.com/jK6zP.jpg""&gt;http://i.imgur.com/jK6zP.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that I have it and have ridden a bit, I have a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biggest issue - space between the seat and pedals is &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; too short.  Obvious solution is to raise the seat and worst case buy one of those seat stems that bend backwards.  No brainer I&amp;#39;d think?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, one issue that will cause is, I&amp;#39;ll have to lean waaaaay over to reach the handlebars.  Is there some sort of an extension I can get to raise the handlebars 3 to 6 inches?  (This is my most important question, and couldn&amp;#39;t really find anything on google.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally - the rear brakes don&amp;#39;t grab really well.  Not oily or anything like that, but they really slip.  Could it possibly be old brittle brake pads?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any help on this!&lt;/p&gt;

,bicycles,"I just bought a new single speed bike and so far it is great, but there is a slight clicking/pinging when I press down on the pedals as I accelerate.

I was able to reproduce the noise by setting the bike upside down and applying pressure to the pedal while resisting the motion with my other hand on the wheel.

I decided to flip the rear wheel around to try out the bike as a fixie (it has a flip-flop hub) and the pinging disappeared.

,bicycles,"Hello everyone! This is my first post in this subreddit. Please bear with me while I explain this situation:

Four friends and myself are doing a 1000 mile tour to MO from VA in the beginning of April. I have no experience touring and am not in the best (or worst) of shape, (in fact, 3 of us are in this predicament) and 2 of my comrades are well-seasoned at touring and are willing to help us noobs along, so I feel pretty good about it.

Anyway, I decided to go with Surly's Long Haul Trucker model as I've heard it's very capable for this kind of stuff and is an all-around great bike, and I'm really looking forward to getting very intimate with it. 

So my questions are thus: I am looking to rig out the bike to make it as awesome as possible. I have a rack on the back, but am looking for one on the front that can handle some weight. I would also like to get some fenders and panniers. I don't know anything about the fenders, but as far as panniers go everyone seems to recommend Ortlieb panniers. I have some bike shorts, and suitable camping gear. Really it's just a matter of fitting out the bike (and my body!) in preparation for the trip. I have pretty much all the basic peripherals.

I'm really just looking for ANY advice that would be helpful, whether it's gear-related stuff, training stuff, general wisdom from touring or anything else you might think is relevant.

,bicycles,"Hi there! This is my first post on Reddit.
I know these threads are annoying, but I haven't been able to find help at my local shops or people I know.

I am a 5'6 female looking for a new bike. My price range is up to $1300.

A few examples of bikes I've liked thus far are Bianchi Volpe, MASI CX's and Raleigh Clubman.

I'm looking for a great bike within my price range that will carry my rear panniers, take me to and from work and on long rides.

I'm not looking for a girls bike specifically. I just want a beautiful/classic bike that will last me a long time for what I need it for. I'm not super picky, but the bikes I have liked so far is the style I'm looking for. Steel would be great, but not a deal breaker at all. In my area there are a lot of hills and rainy winters, so maybe a lighter bike is actually better—I don't know.

I'm open to all suggestions, insights and advice. I've had such a trying time at the local bike shops and asking people, I'm hoping you can help.

,bicycles,"I bought a used Kona BMX bike, mainly for just cruising to and from work, short commutes, etc.  Main reason  I bought a bmx is it's small, great for going up and down the elevator.

Here's a pic by the way.  Paid $250.  (Not bad deal?)
http://i.imgur.com/jK6zP.jpg

So now that I have it and have ridden a bit, I have a few questions:

* Biggest issue - space between the seat and pedals is **way** too short.  Obvious solution is to raise the seat and worst case buy one of those seat stems that bend backwards.  No brainer I'd think?  
* However, one issue that will cause is, I'll have to lean waaaaay over to reach the handlebars.  Is there some sort of an extension I can get to raise the handlebars 3 to 6 inches?  (This is my most important question, and couldn't really find anything on google.)  
* Finally - the rear brakes don't grab really well.  Not oily or anything like that, but they really slip.  Could it possibly be old brittle brake pads?

Hi everyone! I saw these bicycles on sale today, and I was wondering what everyone thinks of them. They are around $300, light, stylish, and a combination of fixed gear / single speed. I had been thinking about getting a bicycle for a while, but seeing this ad today prompted me to look into it some more.

Also, is there anything else you might recommend around this price or cheaper?

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! I saw these bicycles on sale today, and I was wondering what everyone thinks of them. They are around $300, light, stylish, and a combination of fixed gear / single speed. I had been thinking about getting a bicycle for a while, but seeing this ad today prompted me to look into it some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, is there anything else you might recommend around this price or cheaper? I haven&amp;#39;t had a bike in a long time and I am seeking something for running errands and some leisure riding, perhaps through the park or on a nice day in the city, probably nothing too intense.
