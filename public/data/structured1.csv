"Hello everyone! This is my first post in this subreddit. Please bear with me while I explain this situation:

Four friends and myself are doing a 1000 mile tour to MO from VA in the beginning of April. I have no experience touring and am not in the best (or worst) of shape, (in fact, 3 of us are in this predicament) and 2 of my comrades are well-seasoned at touring and are willing to help us noobs along, so I feel pretty good about it.

Anyway, I decided to go with Surly's Long Haul Trucker model as I've heard it's very capable for this kind of stuff and is an all-around great bike, and I'm really looking forward to getting very intimate with it. 

So my questions are thus: I am looking to rig out the bike to make it as awesome as possible. I have a rack on the back, but am looking for one on the front that can handle some weight. I would also like to get some fenders and panniers. I don't know anything about the fenders, but as far as panniers go everyone seems to recommend Ortlieb panniers. I have some bike shorts, and suitable camping gear. Really it's just a matter of fitting out the bike (and my body!) in preparation for the trip. I have pretty much all the basic peripherals.

I'm really just looking for ANY advice that would be helpful, whether it's gear-related stuff, training stuff, general wisdom from touring or anything else you might think is relevant. Thanks for all your help! Love you guys :D",2,3,0.183,0.025,0.792,0.994,1.0

So now that I have it and have ridden a bit, I have a few questions:

* Biggest issue - space between the seat and pedals is **way** too short.  Obvious solution is to raise the seat and worst case buy one of those seat stems that bend backwards.  No brainer I'd think?  
* However, one issue that will cause is, I'll have to lean waaaaay over to reach the handlebars.  Is there some sort of an extension I can get to raise the handlebars 3 to 6 inches?  (This is my most important question, and couldn't really find anything on google.)  
* Finally - the rear brakes don't grab really well.  Not oily or anything like that, but they really slip.  Could it possibly be old brittle brake pads?

"I'm a big guy (~110 kg) who is working on increasing his distance and time in the saddle. Last year I rode over 1000 miles and this year I'm on pace to top 2000. At present, my limiting factor is saddle discomfort. I'm riding a Kona Dew Drop Deluxe with the stock saddle, and I wear padded bike shorts for rides over 20 miles.

I've read the Sheldon Brown article on bike saddles, and I've read a few past posts on reddit about saddles. But I'm still left with three questions:

If I have my saddle level, the nose of it digs into my nutsack like it was designed by my ex-wife. I find I have to ride with my saddle tilted forward so much that every time I bring the bike to the shop they offer to ""fix it"" for me.

2) It seems like there is a strong emphasis on a) avoiding particularly padded saddles, b) wearing padded bike shorts. This always confused me. Why is padding on the saddle bad but padding on my shorts good?

3) I'm strongly considering a noseless saddle, despite recommendations against it on Sheldon's page. Anyone want to give me further reasons why going noseless would be a bad decision?",4,6,0.076,0.083,0.84,-0.418,-1.0

* However, one issue that will cause is, I'll have to lean waaaaay over to reach the handlebars.  Is there some sort of an extension I can get to raise the handlebars 3 to 6 inches?  (This is my most important question, and couldn't really find anything on google.)  
* Finally - the rear brakes don't grab really well.  Not oily or anything like that, but they really slip.  Could it possibly be old brittle brake pads?

It generally happens twice for each stroke (four times per rotation) and I can't figure out exactly where it is coming from.  I tried tightening the pedals, swapping the pedals with a different set, and tightening the crank arms.

I was able to reproduce the noise by setting the bike upside down and applying pressure to the pedal while resisting the motion with my other hand on the wheel.

Any thoughts on what this could be?

UPDATE:
I decided to flip the rear wheel around to try out the bike as a fixie (it has a flip-flop hub) and the pinging disappeared.  This makes me believe it was one of two things: either something within the single speed hub itself or the chain being too tight.  I really like riding it fixed gear so I haven't switched it back to try to diagnose which of these it was.

"I am new to bicycling(don't yet own a bike) but am wondering if commuting to work might be something for me. I live approx 3 miles from work, fairly wide newer roads, bikes are fairly common(see 2-5 on any given trip to work). I work as a manager so business casual or higher is required in what I wear. I live in Texas, it gets hot as hell(100+ 3-4 months of the year).

I have a few questions,

* How do I solve the dress code issues(biking in a suit doesn't sound practical)?
* What sort of bike should I check out?(We have tons of LBS in San Marcos).
* What other ammunition can y'all provide to help me make this pitch to my wife(for the bike capital).

Thank you everyone for your input.

"Some backround:
I got this bike in Target in...2007, or 2008? It's a 26' Schwinn Trailback I believe. 
I've popped the tire a while back and I wanted to replace the innertube. The problem is, standard 26 inch tubes won't work. The schrader valve on most 26 inch tubes aren't long enough for the funky rims on this bike. My friend, who's pretty into biking, took me around to the local bike shops, but none of them seemed to have a tube with a long enough schrader valve. 

My question is this: Did some asshole at Schwinn make some kind of deal with the tire company so they could have a monopoly on bike tubes, or are there actual 26 inch tubes out there with a long enough schraeder? (I believe the average is 1.25 inches, and this one is around 2.)

"I'm a big guy (~110 kg) who is working on increasing his distance and time in the saddle. Last year I rode over 1000 miles and this year I'm on pace to top 2000. At present, my limiting factor is saddle discomfort. I'm riding a Kona Dew Drop Deluxe with the stock saddle, and I wear padded bike shorts for rides over 20 miles.

If I have my saddle level, the nose of it digs into my nutsack like it was designed by my ex-wife. I find I have to ride with my saddle tilted forward so much that every time I bring the bike to the shop they offer to ""fix it"" for me.

2) It seems like there is a strong emphasis on a) avoiding particularly padded saddles, b) wearing padded bike shorts. This always confused me. Why is padding on the saddle bad but padding on my shorts good?

3) I'm strongly considering a noseless saddle, despite recommendations against it on Sheldon's page. Anyone want to give me further reasons why going noseless would be a bad decision?",5,6,0.076,0.083,0.84,-0.418,-1.0

* Finally - the rear brakes don't grab really well.  Not oily or anything like that, but they really slip.  Could it possibly be old brittle brake pads?

I'm thinking about converting this to a fixie or a 3-speed hub gear bike. I'm still new to this, so I have no idea if either of these are within the realm of possibility.

To my nascent eyes, I'd say this is a steel frame. The components were fairly cheap-ish as far as I can tell, so I'm interesting in stripping it and starting anew. Here's an album of a few pix I took:

"Has anyone here own(ed) or ridden a Koga (Dutch manufacturer) bicycle? Specifically, something like a light touring/commuter bike? I stumbled across their website and they seem to be one of the few larger bike manufacturers I have found that let you piece together a custom build online. I am sort of particular about my bicycles; I want a (relatively) light bicycle, disk brakes, flat bars with optional ends, straight cross-tube, normal 18-27 speed gearing (no integral hubs), maybe light shock absorption on the front forks and seat post (without sacrificing weight too much), and plenty of points of attachment for racks, water bottle holders, etc. Anyway, I got into playing around with this configuration thing on the website and discovered that I can make my ""dream"" bike (well, at least it looks like it). The only problem is, this Koga company only has one retailer in the US, somewhere in Maryland. Thinking that it wouldn't be wise to just up and order a bike and have it shipped to me from afar when I haven't test ridden something at least similar, I could use input from anyone that has experience with newer bikes from this manufacturer.

"Hello everyone!

I recently came across a Centurion Super Tour 15. I've done a little Google searching, found some information. Over all I want this bike for commuting and a little exercise. The tires that came on it are Kenda 27x 1 1/4. And, wheel, I need new tires! A week after I got the bike both front and back tires are flat. I'm going to be using it for mostly commuting so I'd like something that can withstand some damage but I'd like to reduce the damage to my wallet. Any suggestions?",1,0,0.091,0.062,0.847,0.2319,1.0
"My first main task is getting a frame. Is a steel frame cheaper than a carbon fiber frame; what're the main differences besides weight? Are the steel frames generally stronger? Could I find one (unbranded or branded) easily for &lt;= $200 of exceptional quality? And if so, does anyone know a good place to order them?

Any other suggestions about different parts? It'll be a multi-speed. I currently have an early 80s Schwinn World, and I love it :-) But I'm into building things and making things myself, and I've been thinking about this project for a while; so I thought I'd come here and ask :-)

"A little bit about myself: I am 6'2"", 200 lbs and I am a weight lifter. I focus mainly on my upper body so it is large compared to my lower. I would like to work on my stamina, my lower body and tone up. I am also hoping to make this a regular hobby.

The only bicycle I have owned was a Scwinn mountain bike I bought from Toys Я Us. I rode it for several years but I haven't ridden in quite some time.

My dad used to race road bikes but he has been out of the game for a few years. So do you guys have any recommendations or places for me to go to for some information? I am not looking to spend a ton of money. I would like to keep it less than $500. Anything would be an improvement over my previous bike.

P.S. I hope this is the correct subreddit.",1,0,0.096,0.019,0.885,0.9209,1.0
"I just bought a new single speed bike and so far it is great, but there is a slight clicking/pinging when I press down on the pedals as I accelerate.  It generally happens twice for each stroke (four times per rotation) and I can't figure out exactly where it is coming from.  I tried tightening the pedals, swapping the pedals with a different set, and tightening the crank arms.

I was able to reproduce the noise by setting the bike upside down and applying pressure to the pedal while resisting the motion with my other hand on the wheel.

Any thoughts on what this could be?

UPDATE:
I decided to flip the rear wheel around to try out the bike as a fixie (it has a flip-flop hub) and the pinging disappeared.  This makes me believe it was one of two things: either something within the single speed hub itself or the chain being too tight.  I really like riding it fixed gear so I haven't switched it back to try to diagnose which of these it was. 

Thanks for all the input!",2,8,0.075,0.026,0.899,0.8893,1.0

"I am new to bicycling(don't yet own a bike) but am wondering if commuting to work might be something for me. I live approx 3 miles from work, fairly wide newer roads, bikes are fairly common(see 2-5 on any given trip to work). I work as a manager so business casual or higher is required in what I wear. I live in Texas, it gets hot as hell(100+ 3-4 months of the year).

I have a few questions,

* How do I solve the dress code issues(biking in a suit doesn't sound practical)?
* What sort of bike should I check out?(We have tons of LBS in San Marcos).
* What other ammunition can y'all provide to help me make this pitch to my wife(for the bike capital).

Thank you everyone for your input.

Edit 1: I work the evening shift so I will be returning home at midnight 4 nights/week.

Edit 2: I'd also like to use the bike for pleasure rides/fitness reasons. My wife is planning to get a bike as well for the same reasons(minus the commuting, she works from home).",7,17,0.115,0.0,0.885,0.9717,1.0
"A bunch of young'ns and I are hoping to improve some *problem* found in bicycles today. Problems like, for instance, bottom bracket seals adding drag to the cranks. Or, maybe, the difficulties involved with attaching a front derailleur, and getting the cable tension right.

I'm hoping to mine your collective knowledge, to see what problems *anyone* has experienced, for which they have not found an answer! We're considering any problem at all, even if that problem is ""the cost is too damn high!""

"Some backround:
I got this bike in Target in...2007, or 2008? It's a 26' Schwinn Trailback I believe. 
I've popped the tire a while back and I wanted to replace the innertube. The problem is, standard 26 inch tubes won't work. The schrader valve on most 26 inch tubes aren't long enough for the funky rims on this bike. My friend, who's pretty into biking, took me around to the local bike shops, but none of them seemed to have a tube with a long enough schrader valve. 

My question is this: Did some asshole at Schwinn make some kind of deal with the tire company so they could have a monopoly on bike tubes, or are there actual 26 inch tubes out there with a long enough schraeder? (I believe the average is 1.25 inches, and this one is around 2.)
