Four friends and myself are doing a 1000 mile tour to MO from VA in the beginning of April. I have no experience touring and am not in the best (or worst) of shape, (in fact, 3 of us are in this predicament) and 2 of my comrades are well-seasoned at touring and are willing to help us noobs along, so I feel pretty good about it.

Anyway, I decided to go with Surly's Long Haul Trucker model as I've heard it's very capable for this kind of stuff and is an all-around great bike, and I'm really looking forward to getting very intimate with it. 

So my questions are thus: I am looking to rig out the bike to make it as awesome as possible. I have a rack on the back, but am looking for one on the front that can handle some weight. I would also like to get some fenders and panniers. I don't know anything about the fenders, but as far as panniers go everyone seems to recommend Ortlieb panniers. I have some bike shorts, and suitable camping gear. Really it's just a matter of fitting out the bike (and my body!) in preparation for the trip. I have pretty much all the basic peripherals.

I know these threads are annoying, but I haven't been able to find help at my local shops or people I know.

I am a 5'6 female looking for a new bike. My price range is up to $1300.

A few examples of bikes I've liked thus far are Bianchi Volpe, MASI CX's and Raleigh Clubman.

I'm looking for a great bike within my price range that will carry my rear panniers, take me to and from work and on long rides.

I'm not looking for a girls bike specifically. I just want a beautiful/classic bike that will last me a long time for what I need it for. I'm not super picky, but the bikes I have liked so far is the style I'm looking for. Steel would be great, but not a deal breaker at all. In my area there are a lot of hills and rainy winters, so maybe a lighter bike is actually better—I don't know.

So now that I have it and have ridden a bit, I have a few questions:

* Biggest issue - space between the seat and pedals is **way** too short.  Obvious solution is to raise the seat and worst case buy one of those seat stems that bend backwards.  No brainer I'd think?  
* However, one issue that will cause is, I'll have to lean waaaaay over to reach the handlebars.  Is there some sort of an extension I can get to raise the handlebars 3 to 6 inches?  (This is my most important question, and couldn't really find anything on google.)  
* Finally - the rear brakes don't grab really well.  Not oily or anything like that, but they really slip.  Could it possibly be old brittle brake pads?

Hi everyone! I saw these bicycles on sale today, and I was wondering what everyone thinks of them. They are around $300, light, stylish, and a combination of fixed gear / single speed. I had been thinking about getting a bicycle for a while, but seeing this ad today prompted me to look into it some more.

Also, is there anything else you might recommend around this price or cheaper? I haven't had a bike in a long time and I am seeking something for running errands and some leisure riding, perhaps through the park or on a nice day in the city, probably nothing too intense. The only requirement that I have is that it should be lightweight so I can carry it up the stairs to my apartment.

,bicycles,"Hello everyone! This is my first post in this subreddit. Please bear with me while I explain this situation:

Four friends and myself are doing a 1000 mile tour to MO from VA in the beginning of April. I have no experience touring and am not in the best (or worst) of shape, (in fact, 3 of us are in this predicament) and 2 of my comrades are well-seasoned at touring and are willing to help us noobs along, so I feel pretty good about it.

Anyway, I decided to go with Surly's Long Haul Trucker model as I've heard it's very capable for this kind of stuff and is an all-around great bike, and I'm really looking forward to getting very intimate with it. 

So my questions are thus: I am looking to rig out the bike to make it as awesome as possible. I have a rack on the back, but am looking for one on the front that can handle some weight. I would also like to get some fenders and panniers. I don't know anything about the fenders, but as far as panniers go everyone seems to recommend Ortlieb panniers. I have some bike shorts, and suitable camping gear. Really it's just a matter of fitting out the bike (and my body!) in preparation for the trip. I have pretty much all the basic peripherals.

I'm really just looking for ANY advice that would be helpful, whether it's gear-related stuff, training stuff, general wisdom from touring or anything else you might think is relevant.

,bicycles,"I bought a used Kona BMX bike, mainly for just cruising to and from work, short commutes, etc.  Main reason  I bought a bmx is it's small, great for going up and down the elevator.

Here's a pic by the way.  Paid $250.  (Not bad deal?)
http://i.imgur.com/jK6zP.jpg

So now that I have it and have ridden a bit, I have a few questions:

* Biggest issue - space between the seat and pedals is **way** too short.  Obvious solution is to raise the seat and worst case buy one of those seat stems that bend backwards.  No brainer I'd think?  
* However, one issue that will cause is, I'll have to lean waaaaay over to reach the handlebars.  Is there some sort of an extension I can get to raise the handlebars 3 to 6 inches?  (This is my most important question, and couldn't really find anything on google.)  
* Finally - the rear brakes don't grab really well.  Not oily or anything like that, but they really slip.  Could it possibly be old brittle brake pads?

Thanks for any help on this!

I got this bike in Target in...2007, or 2008? It's a 26' Schwinn Trailback I believe. 
I've popped the tire a while back and I wanted to replace the innertube. The problem is, standard 26 inch tubes won't work.
