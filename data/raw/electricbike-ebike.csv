I dont have great knees or back and trying to keep moving on a bike.  

The max motor power for where i live is 750w.  I understand my weight limits my range and top supported speed based on that max motor size, but looking at larger batteries for the bike is a nice option to add range.

I am not sure on total range, but lets look at 20ish miles, but I might want more later on.

I was looking at some of the bikes on sixthreezero, but im not sure what a good brand is yet.  I don't plan going very fast but i would like to commute to work and back, which is about 13 miles round trip.  I don't know if I can charge it at work yet.   I was looking at their Simple Step-Thru 20"" 500W E BikeSimple Step-Thru 20"" 500W E Bike as an example style.  I like the smaller tires, but I'm open to other options.

There are a fair number of hills, I am not going up or down extremely large hills.  We do have a lot of rain here, so something that is rated for rain and water is a huge plus.  Splash guards are a huge plus as well. 

  
I am not ready to talk budget, it will be roughly 2k, so I think i have some good options.  Any information or suggestions that are just the technologies to look for would be great as well.

,ebikes,"Under [SB 1271](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1271), nearly all Class 3 ebikes (specifically, all those with a throttle) are re-classified from electric bicycles to motorized bicycles. Has anyone tried to comply yet?

From my understanding, the biggest changes are:

* Some jurisdictions may have rules that change where you can ride
* You must register your bike with the DMV

In order to register with the DMV, you need to:

* Obtain a motorcycle license
* Apply for a VIN
* Complete a one-time registration (not annual)
* Attach the plate they provide

Even though I don't expect heavy enforcement (this is primarily targeted at sellers), I would like to be compliant when in California. However, from what I can tell online, the DMV isn't really set up to provide VINs to vehicles without turn signals, brake lights, etc. It seems like a lot of people put the bike serial number in there and the paperwork tends to get approved.

I'll also reach out to Lectric, as they are probably dealing with this quite a bit!



Aside...

The intent of the law is to prevent parents from accidentally buying a convertible class 2 bike for their under 16 child who then switches it to class 3 and rides illegally. However, it's really going to mess up the market in the short term as most class 3 bikes are class 3 optional, and this creates two separate markets.

While I don't really agree with the changes here, a nice side benefit is that I typically *want* a class 3 with no throttle. Primary reason? Without a throttle, ebikes are covered under most home/property insurance without additional charge (even if it's stolen away from home).

,ebikes,"Hi all, it's my first post in this sub-reddit, so I hope I'm in the right place. I'm an avid cyclist. I commute to work in Vermont year-round and have done so for years. I have a \~25 mile daily commute round trip in rural Vermont. My job sometimes has me seeing people in other areas, so I've racked up to \~50 miles in the course of a work day.

My bicycle is **my only means of transportation.** When I don't have it, I pay \~30 a day for ubers each way to work. Every day it is in the shop costs me money. To file a warranty claim, in my experience with Specialized, is going to take at least 3-4 weeks to actually be completed with me riding. 

With these options, I can either pay the shop to fix my bike so I don't drain my bank account on ubers or not have transportation of any kind. I will add that around here it is 50/50 to ever get an uber when you need it. This adds a totally fucked up dimension of stress to my life.

I've had Specialized bikes for years. I love them. They have always been solid. When I moved to an area with lots of elevation changes, I decided to take the plunge and buy an e-bike. Specialized had always been amazing. I read the reviews. I saw how happy everyone was with the product.

People said I was crazy to pay \~5,000 for a bicycle. I told them I was getting a new product with an awesome warranty, from a great company. I currently am paying the bike off several hundred dollars a month. To have a reliable ride, to be able to bike farther and see more, I was willing to pay.

About 1 month after owning the bike, I had the first issue. I was in the middle of my ride 5 miles between home and work when the battery/engine quit. It would turn on, turn red, then turn off. I had to walk my bike 5 miles to the bike shop. They fixed the problem in two days. I was charged for this work, it was not paid for by my warranty for whatever reason.

A week later, I discovered that my right crank had ground down to nothing, damaging my bearing and ruining the crank. This cost me \~150 to fix. Bike was in the shop for 3 days. I asked Specialized if they would cover the work. They told me to talk to the bike shop. The bike shop told me to talk to Specialized.

One month later, the motor died. I do not know why or how, but the motor just died completely. This is about \~3 months into ownership. I file a claim with specialized who thank God are willing to do the right thing. It takes them a little over a month to get me the new motor.

The bike shop offered to install a ""loaner"" from another bike while I waited. I had no choice. They charged me 250 total to install and rent me this motor for the month. Specialized refused to help me in any way with this.

This loaner engine would go on to die and come back to life intermittently over the course of the month. Sometimes it would work. Sometimes the screen wouldn't turn on. Sometimes it turned red. I paid 250 to worry my ass off every day wondering if I'd make it to my job. Jesus christ. 

2 months go by. I'm really stoked feeling like I hit a little speed bump but the worst was over. I was pissed about the money I spent out of pocket, but I was grateful just to have my bike. This is when the battery dies completely. Not the motor, the battery.

The shop has no idea what happened. They can only tell me it's dead. They file a claim with Specialized for a new battery. In the meantime, guess what, they take a battery out of an older bike and put it in mine. Except they can't rent it, they have to sell it outright.

They actually helped me out greatly by reducing the price. They gave me this battery for 200 and 50 to install it. Another 250 dollars down the drain that I will not get back. I will note even need this damn battery and I'm sure I won't be able to sell it.

I am riding around with this loaner battery for \~7 days before it gives me the first red light stuff. It beeps shuts down and wont turn back on. I leave the bike for a couple of hours, come back and it turns on. I am again riding a bike that I have no idea of whether it will work or not. Will I get to work? Will I be stranded in 0F weather? 

You can pedal the bike yes, but it's heavy man. Doing a 12 mile ride on that big chunk of aluminum is the ""not fun"" side of bike commuting. 

So, between parts, service, arranging for rides when my bike is broken etc. I reckon I can safely say I have put 2,000 into this enterprise on top of the 5,000 I spent initially. I know I'm forgetting a few little things that happened in the beginning (both disc rotors were not true, squeaked like crazy and had to be fixed on day one, just as  an example, plenty of other stuff went wrong).

Getting this bike has totally screwed me. It was supposed to make my life so much easier. Now I'm spending every minute on the bike paranoid, praying it will take me where I need to go, praying that I won't have to put more money into it. It's probably the worst conusmer experience I have ever had in my life.

I am so let down. If I could go back in time, I never would have gotten this stupid ebike. I would have gotten a nice, normal bike like I should've gotten in the first place. I feel like such a fool. 

Specialized is totally unsympathetic. They thing waiting 5 weeks at a time for your primary mode of transportation is acceptable. I now have no recourse but to keep trying to fix it. I can't sell it, because it has so many problems. I couldn't do something like that in good faith. I cannot return it obviously. I'm completely screwed.

I really loved Specialized before this. I never would've bought from a different bike brand. So many good memories on my Tarmac. 

I would love it if Specialized would do the right thing and take the bike back. All I want is a normal, non-electric bike that I don't have to worry about incessantly. They sold me a broken product. They sold me a lemon. I'm writing this in the hope that someone will read it and consider doing the right thing.

a 5,000 bike that doesn't even work? Am I on fucking crazy pills? A bike for that price should last a lifetime, be indestructible and come with a robot sidekick. I have bought bikes at thrift shops that were of better quality, lasted longer and were more dependable than this garbage.

Anyone?

,ebikes,"Hey all.

I purchased two used Quest hub motor e-bikes on marketplace.  One of them I got working just fine.  The other has a couple issues.

I gained access to the controller and noticed the PAS plug was disconnected.  Currently the throttle works fine but no PAS (obviously).  With the PAS cable unplugged I get both front and rear lights to turn on and have full throttle.   When I plug in the PAS cable I lose all functionality of the bike.   PAS does not work.  Throttle does not work and the lights do not turn on.  The display lights up as usual and now shows the wrench symbol with a number 9 error which according to the manual says 'check display'.

Can this be a controller issue?  I took the PAS sensor off the bike and inspected it and everything is clean and looks normal and the magnets are all accounted for.

,ebikes,"I've been riding ebikes for about four years now, having covered some 60.000kms. I ride all year, including in the winter. Last winter I had five falls because of the atrocious riding conditions. The city councils in Norway really do not care about clearing the snow, far less about gritting the paths. I've had falls in previous winters, but the winter of 2022/23 was particularly bad.

Because of these, I have started to look into buying an electric trike. My logic is that three wheels, is better stability, more grip, and I won't fall on the ice. So far I have more or less locked my sight on the Cube Trike Electric. Because as far as I've seen, this seems to be the most stable one. As I've heard the cautionary tales about trikes being easy to topple over, depending on which trike one uses. 

But here is what I am unsure about; is a trike worth it? Does anyone have any experiences they could share in using trikes during the winter season? My main concern has to do with engine power. While yes three wheels add more stability, they also add more resistance when riding. Instead of two wheels being dragged in the snow, one has three wheels. The Cube Trike has center motor, but the power output is in the two rear wheels. My concern is if the motor will be able to power both wheels in, say, 5-10 centimeters of snow?

,ebikes,"Hey everyone,

I have a Trek Powerfly 4 hard tail ebike, I rode it everyday in summer and then went on holiday. I came back and rode it around 5 miles and was off it for 10 minutes. I came back and since then it doesn't want to come back to life. 

  
I really want to see if this is the battery or bike, but connecting the power the port directly in the bike and ebike display still works with input from other power source. How likely do Bosch batteries just break for seemingly no reason? Is there anything I can try to fix this without spending £500 on a new one.

,ebikes,"Hey all. I asked a few days ago about getting a moped style ebike for around $800 to $900 and saw if anyone had any recommendations. I was open to different types of bikes and I made a decision. Someone mentioned Velotric and I looked into it.

Two days I went to a local bike shop to buy some new spokes for my old beach cruiser and they also happened to have Velotric bikes there. It was this folding one in a bright blue color. It was pretty fun while test riding it.

I decided on the Velotric Go 1 with a discount for $850 and it also comes with two goodies. My impression from the one I rode and the 2 year warranty sure helped push me to make that purchase. What do you all think?

And he have to disconnect his account so I can use the bike but as he told me he is selling his bike because he’s out of the country and he’s not coming back the only thing that I had of him was his local phone number .

So now I face this problem i can’t use the bike and I can’t reset it either because the only ways are by previous owner which I asked from the app to send him a reset permission and from an authorized dealer which I don’t have in my city .

,ebikes,"Hey, so I wanted to let everyone know that the Walmart's flagship ebike the Concord is a giant Chinese turd. I discovered that there were metal shavings in the rim. Due to incident where the front tire lost all pressure immediately during a 20mph turn. If I'd of not had my motorcycle training I would have been seriously injured.

The inner tube was sliced on the inside of the rim by a metal shaving that was created when they drilled out the spoke holes in the double walled rim.

If you take off the red vinyl rim liner and take a flashlight to the inside of the rim. You might be able to see a metal shaving stuck inside the spoke nipples. 

In the attached email, I show that Phoenix Bicycles knows of the issue. However, I reported it to Sam Hendrickson the man who is Walmart's corporate guy in charge of the bicycles.

Under federal law, if a safety concern is noted and told to the seller they are required to report such to the consumer protection agency of the US government. 

Walmart failed to do so... After all they are rebranding their entire Walmart bike line as Concord. So being forced to recall this bike will be a serious problem for Walmart. 

Perchance you have a Concord and can't get Walmart to respond to a warranty request. I happily give you the email addresses of all of Walmart's people involved with the Concord bicycle.

Between the safety issues and the failure to honor the warranty. Believe it or not they expect you you to ship this bike back to China on order to obtain warranty parts. Seriously. 

You will be out of your bike for months... Using this ludacris system. Walmart has 0 parts on hand to honor the warranty. There only option is to send you another ebike. Especially, when the manufacturer does the sent it to China thing.

Remind them that they labeled it commuter and that the bike is used for the purpose... And that is why they must pay for your transportation to work while they spend months to honor their warranty. Which by the way is an utter joke. 

Someone else on Reddit posted a scan of the owners manual. Look in the back under the warranty. You will see exactly how much they screwed up by publishing that warranty. Normally a lawyer would create the warranty to protect the company. I guess Walmart and Phoenix Bicycles aren't exactly smart are they?

Reach out to me if you have a Concord and have had problems or even if you've not had them.

,ebikes,"Hi all, looking for some thoughts on what to look at to get my wife's ebike back up and working. She has an Uptown ELC bike with a Bafang G010 drive. The bike has been working reasonably well up until recently when my wife was riding the bike and the chain slipped off. She slipped it back on but since then the pedal assist hasn't worked.

We had previous issues with this bike where the cabled speed sensor magnet thing on the pedals was slightly too far away from the magnets on the pedal crank. However this time around, when jiggling it around it hasn't fixed any issues.

I have been through the bike and disconnected and reconnected all cables. The LED control seems to work fine. And when holding the Down button down for 5 secs, the wheel spins slowly.

Any thoughts on what could be wrong? Is there anything on the rear hub that I should look at?

Hi all,

I'm in the market for a fat guy (5'8"", 250 lb) ebike I can use for grocery runs around town primarily (5-10 mile round trips) with occasional rides on our near-ish 12 mile bike path. We have one local bike shop, and they only sell Aventon (and charge extra for working on non-Aventon bikes if they will even work on them), so I've pretty much settled on an Aventon Aventure 2 as the one to get if I go Aventon.

Looking to hear about the pros &amp; cons of ordering direct from Aventon vs. buying from the bike shop. Here are some obvious ones:

\- The bike shop charges $300 more than Aventon does for the same bike. They still also charge $160 to assemble the bike, and they will split the shipping with me if they have to order it (not sure what Aventon charges them for shipping).

\- If I order from Aventon directly, I save $300, the shipping is free, and I still pay $160 for the assembly if I have them do it.

\- The only extra I get for ordering from the shop is 15% off tune ups (so a tune up would be $120 instead. $140 - they also say they charge $120 per hour for ebike service which I assume is on top of that since it's listed separately). It seems like for only $20 difference, I'd need to get 15 tune ups to make up the extra $300.

\- If I order the bike from the shop, I might get more attentive or priority service, but that's never been true for cars in my experience so not sure it would be for bikes either!

I suppose I could also order something like a Lectric XPress 750 (which saves $400/$700 + the $160 assembly) and take my chances that I don't need to ship it back to them for repairs, which they are very clear is at your own expense. It seems like it would be much nicer to have a bike shop repair option.

Anyway, sorry for the ramble.

,ebikes,"First,I'd like to thank you all for sharing your true situations with many e-bike companies. It has greatly helped in my early intervention to hopefully recoup my money and purchase a bike from a reputable dealer. 

A couple of weeks ago after reading many blog articles as well as reviews in Ebikes, I made my first e-bike purchase through Magicycle, as this was highly rated in numerous places as well as a handful of ""best of"" articles. 

About 4 days after my purchase, I became a little concerned with the status of my order being ""sent to dispatch"", with no updates saying it was being processed or shipped within 1-2 days as advertised. I reached out to Magicycle for a status update and did not get a response. I reviewed my PayPal account that I made the purchase with and instead of it showing a pending charge, it was already posted and the seller name was not Magicycle, but only Chinese letters. I confirmed it was actually Magicycle that I ordered from and decided to search specifically for scams and such related to them instead of ""best companies"" or  ""best Ebikes"", and boy did I find a lot. Lots of posts shared stories of being delivered defective bikes, some never delivered, and numerous patrons who never recieved a refund after returns or cancellations. 

I became very nervous and went ahead and sent another email after an unsuccessful attempt to call customer service, and cancelled my order. I ended up having to dispute the charge with my financial institution whom helped to quickly resolve the issue. 3 days after the email and call, I recieved 4 emails from Magicycle customer service. The first was an order update saying the bike had shipped-in response to my initial injury. The second was declining to cancel the order saying the order had already shipped. The third said I could contact them for approval to return the bike once I receive it. The forth was quite aggressive in that they had been contacted and informed by my financial institution that the charge was disputed, but the bike had already shipped, and they had ""proof of my purchase"" and would take legal action if the money or the bike were not returned and handled ""amicably."" 

I replied to one of the emails that they had plenty of time to cancel the order prior to shipping as I'd reached out days prior, had no update, response, or even a notification of shipping. His reply was about what I expected and demanded that I refuse the delivery and contact fedex to try to intercept and have the package returned. Which by the way, was still in California where the company was based. Being a nice person, I did go ahead and try to contact fedex who informed me that only the seller could approve a return. I replied to the last email with a short sentence informing them to call FedEx and moved on with my life. 

I did more research and found a lot of positive information of heybike, decided on a model with them, and initially was going to order only through Amazon to reduce the risk of lost money, but the seller wasn't Amazon, it was Jasion and they had terrible reviews, so I ordered from the company website. 

The charge wasn't as suspicious as with Magicycle, but there was something oddly similar in the webpage for tracking that popped up date my purchase. I tried to research if the companies were affiliated and found nothing except that Heybike has had just as many, if not more issues than Magicycle. 

I decided to throw the towel in and cancel my order and abort the mission of e-bike finding as the market is ridiculously over saturated right now. I canceled the order not even 24 hours after placing it and nearly a day later got an email response asking why I wanted to cancel and they would ""hold"" my order for now. I replied to the email requesting a cancel and my money to be sent back to the bank as well as 5 subsequent emails and 3 phone calls. I got nowhere. My intuition was screaming and by accident I put the FedEx tracking number for the Magicycle purchase in the heybike order tracking. And. Guess. What??? Heybike produced the result and current information on the tracking for the Magicycle. Soooo... It wasn't a FedEx site, it was Heybike. So they are the same company? 

It's all pretty fishy, and long story longer, my last call with heybike, I insisted they send me an email while on the phone confirming the cancellation of my order, which they reluctantly did, and would only say my money would be sent back to my bank 8-15 business days after the finance department reviewed it. Wtf? Did they review it when I made the purchase? They had no answer when I asked why they can immediately withdraw money, but 8-15 days to put it back, and that's only after their review. I'll end up disputing it, I'm sure but wanted to make sure to share this.

,ebikes,"Looking for my first ebike. My current commute to work is 5km each way which has been fine with a normal push bike but it will be more than doubling which will be a struggle in the heat so I'm wanting to upgrade to an ebike. Other than the daily commute I would also use it for going to the shops to get groceries and just general transport as I don't have a car. Most of the cycling will be on bike paths and there will be plenty of heat and rain.

Ideally I'm looking to spend less than 3k but would spend more if it seemed like the right bike. I'm a 5'4"" woman. The style isn't that important, I need good lights and good capacity for storage/ transporting shopping etc. and it needs to be comfortable and reliable. I looked at the Lekker Jordaan and think it looks lovely but I am concerned it may just be pricey because of the style rather than substance? Also concerned it might be a bit heavy so was thinking of maybe something more along the lines of the Specialized Turbo Vado or similar but this doesn't seem to be available much in Australia. Open to all recommendations but something designed/ produced or easy to get in Australia (QLD) would be best.

I looked at the Lekker Jordaan and think it looks lovely but I am concerned it may just be pricey because of the style rather than substance? Also concerned it might be a bit heavy so was thinking of maybe something more along the lines of the Specialized Turbo Vado or similar but this doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be available much in Australia. Open to all recommendations but something designed/ produced or easy to get in Australia (QLD) would be best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any recommendations, looking forward to joining the ebike scene!&lt;/p&gt;

,ebikes,"Looking for input and advice on an ebike that both my wife (5' 5"" \~28"" inseam) and I (6' 3"", 32"" inseam - I have short legs) can comfortably share. Primary use will be short commutes and grocery store runs, all less than 8 miles round trip. I am massively biased towards a belt drive for the cleanliness and maintenance benefits. We live in a relatively flat area, but there are a couple of hills that are about a quarter mile long and max out at a 10% grade. Budget is preferably less that $3000.

  
Summary:

* Fits riders 5'5 - approximately 6'
* Belt drive
* Price &lt;$3000
* Gearing is preferred, but not required
* No particular bias towards either hub or mid drive motors
* Range requirements minimal
* Payload &gt;250 lbs
* Step through / low frame

I have found 10 bikes that come close to meeting those requirements, with table linked below:

1. Lectric One
2. Lectir XP Lite 2.0 JW
3. Priority Current
4. Ride1up Prodigy V2
5. Ride1up Roadster V3

I've decided between these two bikes. 
Originally I was going to go for the [Basis Hybrid](https://www.e-bikesdirect.co.uk/brands/basis/basis-hybrid-full-size-folding-electric-bike-700c-wheel-96ah-battery-black-red/?_gl=1*i70be4*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA9667BhDoARIsANnamQb5daXIG4Zb4S2kz9UK92RZE3x3lsiAf28MSz2nDrpnfVeo-WTm0Q4aAgghEALw_wcB) once I've returned to the UK. It's £800 right now, and I was thinking ""Fine. Give me that one. It's affordable, and good for what I need.""
But reservation, as I cannot find anybody reviewing this specific bike. Another redditor said it's been a solid daily commuter. A friend of mine used a Basis Osprey from ebikedirect and has been good, however he only uses it once a week. And he had some slight frustration with ebikesdirect

Then Santa Claus gave me a good amount of money and so I started to do more research and came across the [Montague ME1](https://www.montaguebicycles.co.uk/products/montague-m-e1-full-size-electric-folding-bike-with-shimano-steps-e6100-mid-drive-motor?variant=42089263825045). And it's a beauty. Bunch of reviews (Wired gave 9/10, and there's a few YouTube videos with the bike in practice and it looks solid quality)
However, in the UK, it's nearly £4,000. I can afford this, but it would be 100% of my Santa Funds.

Both bikes offer a 30 day return, but they're online retailers so I can't really do a test drive without traveling a ridiculous amount to their warehouse.

To get ahead of it. I'm looking for full size, folder, ebike. I'm 6'4"", 100kg and live up a very steep hill and commute 20-30 miles a day. I'm not comfortable locking up my bike outside nor in Central London. I've had a used Brompton but they're just uncomfy and not great for hills tbh. The electric versions don't vibe with me.
