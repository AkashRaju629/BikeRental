The max motor power for where i live is 750w.  I understand my weight limits my range and top supported speed based on that max motor size, but looking at larger batteries for the bike is a nice option to add range.

"Under [SB 1271](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1271), nearly all Class 3 ebikes (specifically, all those with a throttle) are re-classified from electric bicycles to motorized bicycles. Has anyone tried to comply yet?

From my understanding, the biggest changes are:

* Some jurisdictions may have rules that change where you can ride
* You must register your bike with the DMV

In order to register with the DMV, you need to:

* Obtain a motorcycle license
* Apply for a VIN
* Complete a one-time registration (not annual)
* Attach the plate they provide

Even though I don't expect heavy enforcement (this is primarily targeted at sellers), I would like to be compliant when in California. However, from what I can tell online, the DMV isn't really set up to provide VINs to vehicles without turn signals, brake lights, etc. It seems like a lot of people put the bike serial number in there and the paperwork tends to get approved.

I'll also reach out to Lectric, as they are probably dealing with this quite a bit!



Aside...

The intent of the law is to prevent parents from accidentally buying a convertible class 2 bike for their under 16 child who then switches it to class 3 and rides illegally. However, it's really going to mess up the market in the short term as most class 3 bikes are class 3 optional, and this creates two separate markets.

While I don't really agree with the changes here, a nice side benefit is that I typically *want* a class 3 with no throttle. Primary reason? Without a throttle, ebikes are covered under most home/property insurance without additional charge (even if it's stolen away from home). Exactly what I want!",3,17,0.077,0.043,0.881,0.7437,1.0

"As the title suggests, I’m looking to purchase my first gravel bike. I’ve been riding a mountain bike that’s a 10-year-old model gifted to me. Last summer, I really got into biking and completed about 30-40 rides. I absolutely loved it!

This year, I want to take my cycling journey a bit more seriously, focusing on performance and improving my fitness. I love being in nature and therefore a classical racing bike is not an option for me. 

Here’s what’s important to me:

1. **Comfortable riding position**: I’m a bit worried about adapting to the forward position of a gravel bike. So, one of my top priorities is finding a bike with a more upright riding position compared to typical gravel bikes.
2. **Shock absorption**: While most of my trails are straightforward, some sections include technical parts with smaller rocks and roots. Good shock absorption seems to be quite important for me. 
3. **Budget**: I’m looking to spend a maximum of €1500. From what I’ve seen, there are great used bikes on platforms like Buycycle that fit my budget.

I asked ChatGPT for recommendations, and it suggested the following:

* **Impulso Allroad GRX 600 (2021)**
* **Giant Revolt 0**

It suggested way more but I found great sellers for those two within my budget. 

What do you think about these models? Are they good choices for my needs?

"I'm in the market for a new (custom) gravel bike. These two framesets are my final candidates but I'm having a hard time deciding. Both meet my criteria:

* sporty yet beingable to go bikepacking with
* fast-ish
* 50mm of tire clearance
* expensive (lol not really)
* UDH compatible
* available as framesets for a custom build
* available from a local retailer which does proper bike sizing and fitting so I can build a bike that fits me perfectly

  
There are some pros and cons for either frame:

I can get the 3T a bit cheaper than the ENVE. It has a bigger tire clearance; it's made in Italy and has a nice and innovative carbon layup process.

The ENVE looks better to me though (only talking about the shape, I don't like the colors that much) and it has downtube storage which I really like on much current bike.

"Hi! I wanted to get some opinions:

I have a road bike turned gravel bike which gives me problems at my wrists on bumpy terrain. I cannot run super wide tyres because there is only clearance up to about 35mm. The frame is quite heavy and stiff, as it's made of alloy and contains a Fazua e-bike drive.

I got a Shockstop stem and it's pretty cool, but I'm not sure if it's enough to protect my joints. I'm running the elastomer configuration slighty below the recommendation for my weight. It flexes quite a bit, but I could go even lower for very bumpy terrain. Should I? There's basically no info on that on their website unfortunately. Could this make a significant difference?

Or should I get a suspension fork? I think the downside is that it would raise the handlebars significantly, but you can probably adjust for that using a different stem. I can get a dedicated gravel fork with 40mm travel (Fox 32 Float TC Performance Elite) at a good price. 40mm is not a lot of travel tbh, would that make a significant difference compared to the Shockstop? I'm guessing yes because it damps the whole frame and not just the handlebars?

If I go for the fork, can I put the Shockstop on my other road bike? Or is it a good idea to combine both? I'm guessing the Shockstop adds no value, once you're using a suspension fork, but maybe I'm wrong.

Looking forward to your replies! Thank you.",1,27,0.108,0.093,0.798,0.8087,1.0

"Hi! I have a (somewhat modified) Vello Rocky, and after a few muddy and splashy rides lately, I've realized I need a bit of fender protection. I previously tried Vello's own fenders, but despite their high price point, they were really flimsy and had constant clearance problems that required readjustment.

Rear wheel is sorted as I have a nice clip on fender for the back that weighs nothing and gives me good coverage. But I'm getting a lot of backsplash from my front wheel, leading to messy legs and a water bottle on the downtube I'd rather not drink out of.

Found two options, and wondering if anybody has experience with either:

* This ""[speed mullet](https://ass-savers.com/collections/front-fenders-mudguards/products/speed-mullet-regular)"" from Ass Savers looks like it would cover where I need, but their products always seem kind of cheap and flimsy? Anybody tested?
* [I found a front mudguard for the new Brompton G Line](https://www.sjscycles.co.uk/mudguards/brompton-g-line-front-mudguard/?geoc=SE) that looks like it would do the trick. Any reason I couldn't mount this on a non-brompton bike? I believe the front wheel of the Vello has a similar folding mechanism, but I could be mistaken.

Any tips welcome! Thank you!

"Hello.

I've decided between these two bikes. 
Originally I was going to go for the [Basis Hybrid](https://www.e-bikesdirect.co.uk/brands/basis/basis-hybrid-full-size-folding-electric-bike-700c-wheel-96ah-battery-black-red/?_gl=1*i70be4*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA9667BhDoARIsANnamQb5daXIG4Zb4S2kz9UK92RZE3x3lsiAf28MSz2nDrpnfVeo-WTm0Q4aAgghEALw_wcB) once I've returned to the UK. It's £800 right now, and I was thinking ""Fine. Give me that one. It's affordable, and good for what I need.""
But reservation, as I cannot find anybody reviewing this specific bike. Another redditor said it's been a solid daily commuter. A friend of mine used a Basis Osprey from ebikedirect and has been good, however he only uses it once a week. And he had some slight frustration with ebikesdirect

Then Santa Claus gave me a good amount of money and so I started to do more research and came across the [Montague ME1](https://www.montaguebicycles.co.uk/products/montague-m-e1-full-size-electric-folding-bike-with-shimano-steps-e6100-mid-drive-motor?variant=42089263825045). And it's a beauty. Bunch of reviews (Wired gave 9/10, and there's a few YouTube videos with the bike in practice and it looks solid quality)
However, in the UK, it's nearly £4,000. I can afford this, but it would be 100% of my Santa Funds.

Both bikes offer a 30 day return, but they're online retailers so I can't really do a test drive without traveling a ridiculous amount to their warehouse.

"hello to my fav community, 

i’m pretty new to cycling and have been chasing the best model out there within my range to ride in Delhi, India.

a little about me: i’m 6’1 &amp; i am looking for a hybrid/road geared bicycle in the range of 25-35k INR to start with.

i want to know what tyre size should i look for, along with how many gears are enough &amp; the material used in the built of the bicycle.

also, can anyone please recommend the best silent magnetic bicycle stands that i could use to cycle indoors? i have heard about the wahoo kickr core but it’s way above my budget atm. i am willing to invest another 10-15k INR on it.

i am really looking to start cycling latest by this sunday so if anyone could suggest the best bicycle stores in Delhi as well, that would be really appreciated.

best,

"I know this might be a long shot and probably something that never been posted here before . I'm looking at buying a storage unit with this bike inside. Could anyone tell me the make an model. I've tried google and I believe its a Felt. The only identifying features I can see are IA2 SL on the frame , Shimano on the crank arm, EOS on the tires and maybe Hybrid on the rear brakes.

"Hello all! If this is the wrong place to ask or there is a megathread I didn’t see, please let me know!

Anyway, I’m a 38 year-old woman who is 5’ tall, very heavy, and looking to get into bicycling. I haven’t ridden a bike in about 20 years, and have only basic knowledge. I would like bicycle brand or specific mode recommendations, if possible please!

Another woman I spoke to with my same general build (a little taller) said a hybrid 24” woman’s/step-through would be good, and to have a local bike shop tune it, replace the seat to square, and teach me about gears because I have no stinking clue how to do it yet.

I plan on using it mainly for exercise/fun, not as main transportation. The area I live in is primarily flat and suburban to semi-urban, but there are places to ride along (not on!) the beach or on hillier trails, too.

Intended budget is around $300-$400. A little above is ok.

I checked Marketplace but don’t really have a lot of faith in the listings.

Thank you so, so much for any help, recommendations, and tips!",1,11,0.1,0.01,0.89,0.9477,1.0
"Me and my Fiancee are looking for a two bike hitch based rack for the back of our Subaru Forrester. We have an after market 2"" hitch installed and we want something that is reliable but doesn't stick out super far as our parking situation at our townhouse (parallel street parking) is very compact.

We both ride cheap (sub $700) hybrid bikes and mostly do inner city and very simple nature trails (not mountain bike territory).

Ideally we would want something that still allows us to access our rear hatch door as we use it frequently.

Are there an easy to use/remove hitch-based bike racks for two that are both compact and reliable?

"This is my father's late 80's Nishiki Colorado. It was originally a mountain bike but he reconfigured it to be a hybrid. This is the first vehicle of my father's that I took for an unauthorized joy ride. It still hangs in his garage today. He will be 79 in March.

"Hello everyone I’m very new into cycling and am on the fence on buying a mercier kilo tt, or some type of fitness-hybrid road bike. I’ve researched the learning curve that comes with fixed gears but it seems like a fun challenge I’d be willing to try. I also like the idea of customization and low maintenance parts/fixing.

I believe the main deciding factor will be what I intend on using the bike for. I loving working out and have been consistently for 2 years. I enjoy cardio and want to incorporate cycling for cardiovascular health, muscle endurance (mainly for legs) and for overall fun. Probably would only ride for 30-60 after a workout or early in the morning. No hills in my area. Should I invest in a road/fitness bike? Or can I still reach the same goals with the fun of a fixed gear bike? Any advice is welcomed thanks.",0,16,0.222,0.03,0.749,0.9886,1.0
"I've always preferred hybrid/flatbar bikes, and I've been riding Trek Dual Sport 4 bikes for eight years.  Though I've had my eye on the FX Sport lineup for a couple of years now.  I decided to just go for it and purchased the full-carbon FX6, which also has the SRAM APEX AXS electronic shifting groupset.  I also added the SRAM crank power meter to the bike.  I'm now waiting for some decent weather here in central Indiana, which may be a while!",27,2,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"Hey everyone I've been cycling for a long time for transportation and recently moved to the UK from Spain. I've never had to buy mudguards or think of them specially riding in the city. I haven't brought over my bikes yet but got a cheap GT Transeo (hybrid with front suspension and disc breaks), and need to get mudguards. I'm getting soaked every time I travel. I don't mind spending a bit more but obviously not an insane amount. I was looking for the best amount of coverage as my shoes, shins, calves and butt are getting drenched. Does anyone have advice on what's worth it and what isn't? Thank you all! :)",1,4,0.148,0.021,0.831,0.9546,1.0
